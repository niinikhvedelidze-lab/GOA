    <p>
        <strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong> is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. <br> It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and <br> scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render <br> the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance. <br>

        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded <br> into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, <br>  lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.

        <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) </strong> is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such <br> as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[2] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML <br> and JavaScript.[3]

        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[4] This separation can improve content <br> accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics;<br> enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; <br> and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

        <strong>JavaScript (JS)[a]</strong> is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995.[6] Ninety-nine percent <br> of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10]

        Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also <br> utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.[11]

        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time–compiled <br> language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[12] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, <br> functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
