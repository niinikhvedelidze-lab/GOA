                My <em>name is Nino,</em>
            </h3>but i'd prefer if you were to call me <u>
                <em>Nina</em>
            </u>. I have passion for <i>CS</i>, particularly <strong><u>Cyber Security</u></strong> <br> I love learning every nuances, looking through any given detail, and taking the matter to a deeper depth, no <br> matter what it might be presenting. For me, the most important part about achieving success is putting in your <br> maximum effort, time and quality. Success doesn't just happen, it is achieved, through <strong>Patience and Discipline.</strong>    </p>
